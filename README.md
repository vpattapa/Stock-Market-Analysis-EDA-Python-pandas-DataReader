# Stock Market Data EDA Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on stock market data from various sectors using the `pandas_datareader` function to fetch the data. The analysis is performed sector-wise, concentrating on the Electric Vehicle (EV) sector, Social Media, and Retail.

### Sectors Analyzed

- **Electric Vehicles (EV)**: Analysis includes stocks from Tesla, Ford, Nikola, and Volvo.
- **Social Media**: Includes major social media companies (Meta, Twitter, Snap).
- **Retail**: Focuses on large retail corporations (Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Target).

## Project Structure

The repository consists of multiple Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a different sector of the stock market:

- `EV_Stocks_EDA.ipynb` - Notebook containing EDA for EV stocks like Tesla, Ford, Nikola, and Volvo.
- `Social_Media_Stocks_EDA.ipynb` - EDA for stocks of prominent social media companies.
- `Retail_Stocks_EDA.ipynb` - EDA for leading retail companies.
